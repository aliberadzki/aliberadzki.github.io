This is my first blog entry here. Its purpose is clearly technical: I am just checking out github pages and Jekyll bloging platform.

You can check Jekyll out [here][jekyll-docs]. It is written in Ruby. The whole concept of github pages is explained [here][gh-pages].

Just to have everything tested, small java snippet to see if syntax highlighting works as expected.
{% highlight java %}
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}

{% endhighlight %}

Nice! Hope to see you here later on!
